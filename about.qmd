I have studied political science at the Univeristy of Copenhagen. I currently work at Statistics Denmark within the section of statistical methods. I mainly work with statistical disclosure control, maintaining and developing internal R-packages, statistical data editing and imputation.

I like to collect insights from data and find new ways to use data. Mainly working with data analysis in R, but collecting data from different sources, SQL servers, APIs or web scraping.
